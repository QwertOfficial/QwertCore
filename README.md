# QwertCore
QwertCore is a GUI and extends the healer reaction project. It is not mandatory to use the Reactions, but it offers some advantages, especially for users who don't like to change the Reactions themselves, but would still like to customize their settings.
The advantages include a changeable hotbar, the download of updates with a few clicks and options for the current savage fights.
